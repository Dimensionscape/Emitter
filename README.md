# Emitter Haxe Library

Emitter provides a simple yet powerful and extendable event-like signal emitter system for Haxe 4.2+ projects. It allows you to create and manage signals, subscribe to them, emit event-based signals, and handle callbacks with type safety. This library is especially useful for implementing event-driven architectures and managing communication between different parts of your application while ensuring maximum performance and efficient decoupling.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Callback functions are typed, ensuring that the arguments passed match the expected types.
- **Multiple Signals**: Supports multiple signals, each with its own set of subscribed callbacks.
- **Arbitrary Callback Parameters**: Supports multiple callback type parameters without relying on object creation seen in a typical "EventDispatcher: while also perserving type safety checks in order to avoid errors.
- **Subscription Management**: Easily subscribe to, unsubscribe from and control emitters.
- **Flexible Event Handling**: Supports emitting signals with varying numbers of arguments, including both typed and untyped variations.
- **Simple API**: Designed to be straightforward and easy to use.
- **High Performance**: Built for real world use cases with performance in mind. Emitter outperforms most if not all other available alternative haxelibs designed for event handling.
- **Extendability and Reusability**: Designed for maximum extendability and reusability.
- **Chaining**: Method calls can be chained together for concise and readable code.

## Installation

You can install the Emitter Signals Library via Haxelib:

```bash
haxelib install emitter
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

### Imports
```hx
import emitter.signals.Emitter;
import emitter.signals.SignalType;
```

### Create the Signal
```hx
public static inline var TEST:SignalType1<Int->Void, Int> = "test";
```

### Instantiate a new Emitter and assign a callback to your signal
```hx
// Create an instance of Emitter
var emitter:Emitter = new Emitter();

// Define a callback function for a signal
var callback:Int->Void = function(n:Int) {
    trace("Received data: " + n);
};

// Subscribe to a signal
emitter.on(TEST, callback);

// Emit the signal with an argument
emitter.emit(TEST, 42);

// Unsubscribe the callback from the signal
emitter.off(TEST, callback);
```
